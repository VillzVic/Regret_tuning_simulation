\begin{abstract}

Traditional automatic tuning systems are based on an exploration-exploitation tradeoff that uses  a reference benchmark 
from which tuning parameters are computed throughout several runs of the benchmark entries on the algorithm to tune.
On NP-hard and exponential algorithms, this vision is criticizable because of:  the hardness of finding a reference 
benchmark and  the potential huge runtime of the exploration phase.
In this paper, we introduce QTuning, a new automatic tuning  system specially designed for exponential and NP-hard 
algorithms. As traditional tuning systems, QTuning is based on benchmark runs. But this latter can always be modified. Moreover, 
the system recovers the exploitation and exploitation phases. As a result, a cloud-service tuned with QTuning is constantly 
evolving, because enriched by new optimal or suboptimal configurations discovered in the tuning process. 
The realization of such a system raises several questions related to 
exploration search, programming interface and partial results exploitation. This paper focuses 
on these points. In particular, we describe the QTuning architecture and programming interface and formulate the challenge 
in data exploration as a bi-dimensional random search problem that leads to an  NP-hard problem for data exploitation. 
Finally, we discuss about an experimental 
evaluation of the Qtuning system for the resolution of the satisfiability problem in a real cloud computing environment.

\section{Introduction}

The global objective of this study is to improve the performance of cloud-services in learning their optimal 
configuration in an  in-situ context. We assume a  cloud-service  made of configurable 
time-consuming algorithms like exponential algorithms or  NP-hard algorithms. We also 
assume that the configurable algorithmic parameters are well identified and that benchmarks for their calibration exist. 
In strickly using the cloud resources, our objective is to build an automatic tuning system that will find    
the configurations that optimizes the cloud-service on runtime and/or energy consumption.

The core problem that we address is not new. It was addressed in several past work with  
dense and sparse linear algebra algorithms~\cite{ATLAS,Spiral}, sorting~\cite{Spiral} or Fast Fourier Transform~\cite{FFTW} 
algorithms. Fundamental principles and techniques for automatic tuning have also been formulated in methods, 
systems and frameworks~\cite{Rice,Tapus:2002:AHT:762761.762771,ansel:cases:2012}. Despite these contributions, our work bring 
several novelties when considering the state-of-art of automatic tuning techniques. 

Traditional automatic tuning systems use two kinds of techniques: {\it offline and runtime tuning}~\cite{Tichy:2014:APS:2636925.2636340}. 
In both classes, the tuning is built upon an exploration-exploitation tradeoff where from an input algorithm $A(\vec{\theta})$ 
and a reference benchmark $B$, one computes the optimal values of $\vec{\theta}$ that will minimize the runtime or energy 
consumption induced by the processing of $A(.)$. After this exploration phase, the optimal parameter values are exploited 
for solving any input of $A(.)$. 
In the case of offline tuning, the exploration includes several runs of $A(.)$ on $B$ (for performance profiling) 
and produces an optimal configuration $\vec{\theta}^{opt}$ to use for runing $A(.)$. 
In runtime tuning, instead of an optimal configuration, the exploration generates a {\it decision function} 
that on any input $I$ of $A(.)$ returns the optimal configuration $\vec{\theta}^{opt}(I)$ to use in its processing. 
Offline and runtime tunings have been succesfully applied to many computational problems. However, we do believe that 
these approaches are not suitable to exponential and NP-complete problems. 

Our first disagreement comes from the fact that this exploration-exploitation tradeoff {\it requires a reference or representative 
benchmark} that characterizes the {\it key features} of the inputs accepted by  $A(.)$. Unfortunately, on NP-hard problems, the great 
diversity of problem instances makes it hard to reach a consensus on reference benchmark. International competitions like the annual SAT 
competition~\footnote{http://www.satcompetition.org/} or DIMACS challenge tend to establish such references; but, one can notice 
that their reference benchmarks change every year. 
Our second disagreement comes from the fact that these two tuning techniques assume a profiling stage where performance of 
algorithms are estimated on a reference benchmark. On exponential or NP-hard problem, this stage could take several days, 
months or years. 


In the light of these observations, we argue that the first difference between our work and prior ones is to think 
automatic tuning in an alternative exploration-exploitation tradeoff, more suitable for NP-hard and exponential problems. 
We formulate our alternative as the {\it infinite learning perspective for automatic tuning}. 
In this vision, the tuning is not made of two separated phases of exploration and exploitation. Both phases co-exist 
such that the tuned system evolve throughout the time with new optimal or sub-optimal configurations, discovered in the processing. 
In addition, we reject the idea of a reference benchmark and prioritize the one of dynamic training sets that users 
can configure and modify, on the fly, during the tuning. 
 The implementatation of such a vision implies to invest specially on: 
techniques for exploring the tuning parameters (we want to quickly find good values for parameters), massive data storage (the benchmark 
can be {\it infinitely} large), programming interface (for connecting the algorithms to tune to new uploads of the tuning system) and partial results exploitation (we want to exploit while exploring). The system that we propose in this paper covers all these points. However, it is on the two last points that this paper focuses. 
Let us observe that there exist work in which the perspective we described where almost envisioned. In particular, 
there is the MATE system~\cite{DBLP:conf/para/MorajkoMCMS10} or the {\it tuned} plugin available in Linux (redhat). These systems 
showed how to make evolve the setting of a system by collecting monitored data. However these work consider the long-term tuning more
 as a monitoring process than a search problem.

The second difference between our work and existing ones is that we consider functioning cloud-services to tune in-situ. 
This means that the datacenter resources on which we operate is not dedicated to tuning. Therefore, the exploration process will  
evolve in an agile setting where resources are not always available or execution faults could occur. 

Summarizing, in this paper, we introduce QTuning, a new automatic tuning service that implements the infinite learning perspective for 
tuning, in-situ, in a cloud context. The paper contribution focuses on: the general architecture of the system, the description of its 
programming interface and algorithms for searching the best configuration. 
On these last points, we formulate the challenge in exploration as a bi-dimensional random search problem that leads to 
an NP-hard problem for data exploitation. Finally, we provide heuristic for data exploitation with an experimental evaluation. 

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{Motivation}, we explain the practical motivation of 
our work. In Section~\ref{Related}, we discuss the related work. 
In Section~\ref{Model}, we introduce the key automatic tuning concepts that are manipulated in QTuning. 
The architecture of the system and its programming interface is presented in Section~\ref{Architecture}. 
In Section~\ref{Exploration}, we discuss about the theoretical optimization of data exploration and exploitation in 
QTuning. A practical validation is presented in Section~\ref{Proof-of-concept} and we conclude in 
Section~\ref{Conclusion}.


\section{Motivation} \label{Motivation}

Our initial motivation for designing QTuning was to improve the {\it qombinatorics}~\footnote{qombinatorics.qarnot.net} 
cloud service, available in the Qarnot Computing cloud~\footnote{http://www.qarnot-computing.com/}. Qombinatorics is a SaaS 
developed by the Qarnot Computing Research team for the parallel resolution of NP-hard problems.

The system is deployed in the Qarnot Computing cloud: a heating cloud for HPC that inovated in designing special radiators that produce heat from computations. The Qarnot cloud infrastructure consists of the network of radiators that are deployed in homes and are managed by a private resource manager (Qware) designed by the company. 
In an economic viewpoint, the Qarnot business is based on two types of users: hosts interested in heating and HPC users interested 
in computing. The objective is to use requirements in computations for supplying those in heating.
However, it is obvious to notice that such a system is not always balanced. Typically, in winter, it can happen that we 
do not have enough computations for heating. In these situations, the QTuning system is particularly interesting since it 
can serve for pushing learning jobs that  will serve to improve the functioning of Qarnot services. 



\section{Related work} \label{Related}

As stated in the introduction, automatic tuning  is a well-investigated field. For a general survey on HPC systems based on 
automatic tuning, the interested reader might take a look at the general report of the 2014 Dagstuhl seminary~\cite{benkner_et_al:DR:2014:4423}. 
It is also important to notice that nowadays, automatic tuning, as well as  {\it parallelism} are considered by industrials as one of the 
major strategy for the improvement of algorithmic performance. The invest on performance tuning of SQL requests made by major companies  
like Oracle or IBM is an example~\cite{Oracle}. 

Automatic tuning systems can be ranged in two classes: those that are {\it problem-specific} in the sense that the goal is to tune 
specific algorithms or classes of parameters and those that are {\it problem-independent}. 

In the first class, some convincing examples are: the ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS} library for dense linear Algebra, 
OSKI~\cite{Vuduc:2005zi} on sparse algebra,  the SPIRAL library~\cite{Spiral} for sorting and the FFTW~\cite{FFTW}  
for Fast Fourrier transform. These work demonstrated the efficiency of some key automatic tuning techniques as: the offline and  
 runtime tuning or the dynamic programming approach for algorithms cascading. One general trend in these work is that 
the tuning targets the runtime optimization by finding between different versions of a program, the one that is optimized on data 
access. At this stage, we higlight that in comparison to these prior works, the tuning system that we propose is not restricted to 
a specific problem or type of parameters. Instead, we consider general 
techniques that can be used in a wide range of NP-complete and exponential algorithms.

There are several sytems or frameworks that were proposed for automatic tuning. The AEOS approach~\cite{AEOS} 
summarizes a set of general principles and a component architecture that were succesfully applied for tuning  
serveral dense linear algebra kernel. As discussed before, we do not believe that this solution is suitable for the context we target. 
The OpenTuner framework formulates a new language for general automatic tuning~\cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEpact/AnselKVRBOA14}. 
The system also innovates in implementing ensemble techniques for combining several automatic search algorithms. As OpenTuner, QTuning 
invests on search techniques for tuning exploration. But, our search algorithms differ because we do not have the same 
objective functions.  The Periscope framework~\cite{DBLP:conf/parco/MijakovicSUGSC13} is another general solution for automatic 
tuning in a distributed context. This solution is particularly interesting since it also addresses the tuning for energy efficiency. 
 As Periscope, QTuning is based on distributed search, but our objective in distribution is to diversify the quality of local solutions 
that can be found during the search. Moreover, QTuning differs on how it makes online synthessis of the best tuning results.
ParamILS~\cite{Hutter:2009:PAA:1734953.1734959} is an automatic tuning system especially designed for tuning hard computational 
algorithms like SAT. The exploration algorithms used in QTuning are inspired from random search algorithms defined in ParamILS. 
However, we formulate this search as a combination of breadth and depth first search with the goal of optimizing a regret function. 
As mentioned in the introduction, there already exist work that envisionned the automatic tuning as a long-term process. In particular, there is the MATE system~\cite{DBLP:conf/para/MorajkoMCMS10}, the tuned plugin~\footnote{http://linux.die.net/man/8/tuned} available 
in Linux Redhat or the Green framework~\cite{Baek:2010:GFS:1809028.1806620}. However, none of these work formulated the 
automatic tuning problem as us; while they invested on the idea of improving a system by  monitoring, we consider automatic 
tuning as a search problem.



Finally, let us recall that one of the earlier general automatic tuning systems is the  Algorithm selection 
framework of John Rice~\cite{Rice}.  This work innovated in introducing the key concepts that are nowadays used in most automatic 
tuning system. Our work is largely inspired by the Rice framework it.

In the next section, we will now introduce the key modeling concepts that are manipulated in QTuning. The objective is to 
give more details about the infinite learning vision implemented in QTuning. 


\section{Model} \label{Model}

QTuning is a system in which automatic tuning problems are formulated within the notion of tuning project.  Such  
a project can be  constrained or unconstrained. More formally we have the following definition.

\begin{definition}{\bf (Unconstrained tuning project)}
We define an unconstrained tuning project as a tuple $ \Gamma = (\sigma, \beta, \vec{\theta}, d(\vec{\theta}))$. Here, $\sigma$ is the cloud service to tune; 
$\vec{\theta}$ are the parameters to tune and $d(\vec{\theta})$ is the set of definition domains for each parameter 
$\theta_i \in \vec{\theta}$; $\beta$ is the initial set of training data that will be used for the tuning.
\end{definition}

In QTuning, an unconstrainted tuning project defines a corpus of data used for exploring the parameters of a service. 
The configuration of this basis can be changed anytime. More precisely, there are three types of 
{\it evolutive actions} that can always be performed on a tuning project: the addition of a new entry in $\beta$, 
the deletion of an entry and the deletion of a parameter from $\vec{\theta}$. 

Let us assume that $\vec{\theta} = (\theta_1,\dots \theta_n)$. 
The solution of an unconstrained tuning project is a {\it configuration} $\bar{\theta}_u \in d(\theta_1) \times \dots  \times d(\theta_n)$. 
This search space can be extremely large. But, as we will see, some constraints 
in parameter definition can reduce it. In the experiments, we will consider for instance cases 
where the configuration of $\sigma$ is such that if $\theta_1$ has a given value, then some assignments are no more possible for $\theta_2$. 
We characterize these dependencies between parameters as follows. 

\begin{definition}{\bf (Tuning search space constraint)}
We define a constraint of the search space of a tuning project as a tuple $C = ((\theta_i, v_i), (\theta_j, v_j),\dots (\theta_k, v_k))$. 
The constraint state that we do not authorize the  assignments in which $\theta_i$ is assigned to $v_i$, $\theta_j$ to $v_j$ etc.
\end{definition}

With search space constraints, we can derive an constrained tuning project as $ \Gamma = (\sigma, \beta, \vec{\theta}, d(\vec{\theta}), C)$ 
where $C$ is the set of constraints of the project. In the following, we will only consider constrained tuning project because 
they generalize unconstrained ones. 


For caracterizing the solution of a tuning project, let us assume that on each benchmark entry $\beta_i \in \beta$ 
and assignment of parameters $\bar{p}_u$ we have an estimation $\Delta(\sigma, \bar{p}_u, \beta_i)$ of the 
average runtime required for processing $\beta_i$ by $\sigma$. Then we have the following definition.

\begin{definition}{\bf (Solution of a tuning project)}
The solution of a tuning project $ \Gamma = (\sigma, \beta, \vec{\theta}, d(\vec{\theta}), C)$  is the configuration 
$\bar{\theta}^o$ such that \[ \bar{\theta}^o = \arg \underset{\{\bar{\theta} | C \text{ are not violated }\}}{\min} \frac{1}{|\beta|}\sum_{\beta_i \in \beta} \Delta(\sigma, \bar{\theta}, \beta_i) \] 

\end{definition}

This definition restricts our objective to the minimization of the average runtime in the processing of instances. 
Alternatives optimization goal as the minimization of the makespan or the energy consumption can however be considered. 
Moreover, automatic tuning problems are often formulated as the learning of the coefficient of a non-linear functions~\cite{icl:418} 
that captures the runtime of thes algorithm to tune. However, we are pessimistic about the accuracy of such modeling 
when considering NP-complete problems. 

With the definition we adopted, the problem of finding a solution for a tuning project is a constraint 
optimization problem. We will use this observation will be used further. 

Let us now put some words about the online nature of the tuning problem we address. 
In the infinite learning perspective, we do not envision to exploit the 
the tuned system only when having the optimal configuration $\bar{\theta}^o $. Therefore, during the lifetime of the 
system, at each date $t$ QTuning will return an  intermediary configuration $\bar{\theta}(t)$ that will be used for the processing of instances. 
In assuming that at the date $t$, we have the benchmark $\beta(t)$ we are interested in minimizing the regret i.e the sum of: the difference 
between the average cost for processing $\beta(t)$ with $\bar{\theta}(t)$ and the one cost for processing $\beta(t)$ with the best possible configuration. 
We formalize the regret as: 

\[
\int \left( Cost(\bar{\theta}(t)| \beta(t)) - Cost(\bar{\theta}^o(t) | \beta(t)) \right) dt
\]
where, 
\[
Cost(\bar{\theta}(t) | \beta(t)) = \frac{1}{|\beta(t)|}\sum_{\beta(t)_i \in \beta(t)} \Delta(\sigma, \bar{\theta}, \beta(t)_i) 
\]
We end this modeling part in stating that we also consider special cases that we will refer to as portfolio tuning project. 
These projects aim at capturing cases where the service $\sigma$ is made of a portfolio of parallel algorithms. 
In such projects, there is one parameter $\theta_0 \in \vec{\theta}$ called the {\it portfolio parameter} whose values are positive 
integers. If $\theta_0 = 1$, then the search space is $d(\theta_1) \times \dots  \times d(\theta_n)$. If $p = m$, then the search 
space will be $(d(\theta_1) \times \dots  \times d(\theta_n))^m$. As one can remark these cases consider the tuning in 
a parallel setting. 


\section{The Qtuning architecture} \label{Architecture}

This section discusses about the QTuning architecture. Let us recall that since QTuning was primarily designed 
for the Qarnot Computing cloud, several architectural considerations will be specialized to its setting. However, 
the proposed architecture can be generalized and integrated in other clouds.

\subsection{Deployment architecture}

	\begin{figure*}[hbtp]
	\begin{center}
	%\fbox{
	\input{./Figures/QTuningArch.tex}
	%}
	\caption{In-situ computing with QTuning}
	\label{fig:QTuning}
	\end{center}
	\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:QTuning}, we describe the typical deployment architecture for which the 
QTuning system have been built. Qtuning is composed of an API (available as a library) and 
a server program ({\it QTuning.d}). With the QTuning API, a cloud-service ({\it service.d}) that uses QTuning can 
push new tuning projects and get throughout the time the analytics results. These latter can consist of 
the best configuration found or the parameters that have the greatest impact on the runtime in the 
current exploration stage. For finding these results, QTuning will create tuning jobs from the pushed projects 
and submit them to the cloud resource manager for a processing on cloud resources (In the case of Qarnot, they are Q.rads). 
Performance results about these jobs are next collected and save in a database (Mongodb~\footnote{www.mongodb.org}). This  
database manager was chosen because it is adapted to the storage of massive data. This is expected in the infinite learning 
perspective where the benchmark can be extremly large.

As one can remark, a service connected to QTuning can process user requests while downloading new 
configurations that improves its efficiency. The deployment of QTuning in a new cloud requires that the 
QTuning does  support the cloud resource manager interface (for jobs submission). 
In its current version, the service was developped for the Qware system (of Qarnot Computing);  
but we envison to include the API of other resource managers. In what follows, we will 
present the tuning API and explaing the functioning of {\it QTuning.d}.



\subsection{QTuning API} 

The QTuning API is a c\# library based on five main classes: QTuningFactory, QTuningPost, QTuningGet, QTuningDelete and QTuningResponse. 
The QTuningFactory class is based on the factory design pattern; it serves for the creation of the other objects. 
QTuningPost is used for pushing and modifying new projects while QTuningGet serves for retrieving Analytics data. QTuningDelete is used 
for deleting projects, benchmarks and configurations and QTuningResponse is the main return data type for all actions.

\subsubsection{Pushing a tuning project}
In the listing~\ref{lst:push}, we illustrate a use case of the QTuning API.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Pushing a project in QTuning, label=lst:push]
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using QTuning;

namespace pushtuning
{
  class CreateQsatTuningProject{
   public static List<QParameterBase> GetParameterList(){
     List<QParameterBase> param = new List<QParameterBase>();
     QParameter<string> policy = new QParameter<string>("Policy");
     policy.AddValues("luby", "pico", "lex");
     QParameter<int> restartFactor = new QParameter<int>("RestartFactor");
     restartFactor.AddValues(5,10,15,20,30,40);
     QParameter<int> teamSize = new QParameter<int> ("TeamSize");
     teamSize.AddValues(4,5,6,7,8);
     teamSize.IsPortfolioSize = true;
     param.AddMany(policy, restartFactor, teamSize);
     return param;			
   }
   public static List<QUndef> GetUndefList(){
     List<QUndef> constraints = new List<QUndef>();
     constraints.Add(new QUndef("Policy", "luby", "restartFactor", 15));
     return constraints;		
   }
   public static QBenchmark GetBenchmark(){
     QBenchmark bench = new QBenchmark("QSatTuning");
     string basedir = "./test/distrib-shuffled/";
     bench.AddBenchSubDir(basedir+"handmade/bevan/cnf",
     basedir+"handmade/markstrom/SATISFIABLE");
     return bench;
   }
   public static DockerProfile GetConfigureDocker(){
     DockerProfile dp = new DockerProfile();
     dp.InputConstFileName = "QSAT_INPUTFILE";
     dp.OutputConstFileName = "QSAT_OUTPUTFILE";
     dp.DockerProfileName = "qsattuning";
     return dp;		
   }
   public static void Main(string[] args){
     string IPAddress = "192.168.6.104";		
     string port = "8065";
     QTuningFactory factory = new QTuningFactory(IPAddress, port);	
     QTuningPost req = factory.GetTuningProfile("QSATuning");

     req.GetDocker_Constants = new GetDockerConstants(GetConfigureDocker);
     req.Define_ParameterList = new DefineParameterList(GetParameterList);
     req.Define_Benchmark = new DefineBenchmark(GetBenchmark);
     req.Define_Undef = new DefineUndef(GetUndefList);

     QTuningResponse resp = req.Submit();
     if(resp.Status.Equals("OK")){
       Console.WriteLine ("The project key: " + resp.AppKey);
     else
       Console.WriteLine ("Submission failed, Error: " + resp.Message);
   }
  }
}

\end{lstlisting}

The code defines a constrained tuning project   $ \Gamma = (\sigma, \beta, \vec{\theta}, d(\vec{\theta}), C)$ and submits it 
to the QTuning server. 
$\beta$ is defined in the function {\it GetBenchmark()} and modeled as an object of type {\it QBenchmark}, $\vec{\theta}$ 
is defined in {\it GetParameterList()} the constraints $C$ are defined in {\it GetUndefList()} and 
$\sigma$ is defined in {\it GetConfigureDocker()}. Once these elements defined, the code instanciates a factory 
object from the IP address $192.168.6.104$ and port $8065$. This call assumes that the QTuning server is deployed at this 
IP address and is listening on this port (we will come back latter). From the factory, an empty tuning project is created 
and returned in the  QTuning post object; the project name here is "QSATuning". The project is then configured and 
 submitted to the server with the method {\it QTuningPost.Submit()}. If the submission is successfully completed, 
a {\it project key} is returned. It will serve latter for gathering data about the submission.

One can notice that the API includes also several objects that we did not mentioned like {\it QParameterBase}, {\it QBenchmark},
{\it DockerProfile}  or {\it QUndef}. 
We will not focus on their functioning here; but it is quite intutive. When defining parameters, we set the portfolio parameter 
(see Section~\ref{Model}) with the attribute {\it QParameterBase.IsPortfolioSize} is used for stating that a parameter is the portfolio parameter.
In the current version, there is only one such parameter per tuning prject. Constraints are defined by setting their list of parameters 
followed by their values ({\it QUndef}). Finally for referring to a service, we must define its profile name (see the next section) 
and the input and output files that it expects. Moreover, the profile must also be defined such as to support the input format 
assumed in QTuning. This is discussed in the next section.

\subsubsection{Input requirements}
The usage of docker profile in QTuning comes from the fact that the Qware system uses the docker container technologies:  
an alternative to virtual machines whose efficiency was demonstrated on HPC applications~\cite{DBLP:conf/ispass/FelterFRR15}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Json input data representation in QTuning, label=lst:rep]

{
   "source": "QTuning_random_search_1D"	
   "date": "2015-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"						
   "instance_file_path": "./job/bevan1.cnf"
   "size": "110K" 	
   "parameters":{
       "parallel": "true"
       "TeamSize": "2"
       "team_configuration": [
         {
	    "Policy": "luby"
	    "RestarFactor": 5
	 }
	 {
	    "Policy": "pico"
	    "RestarFactor": 10
        }
      ]
   }
}
\end{lstlisting}

 
The docker image of a service in QTuning is manipulated throughout a docker profile. This profile defines several information like 
the input and output files requested by the image are important. For using the service with QTuning, this latter one must support 
the QTuning input data format. This latter ones is represented as an XML or JSON file (used by default). 

An example of a JSON input representation is given in the listing~\ref{lst:rep}. The JSON has 5 elements: "source" that indicates 
{\it which algorithm} generated the file (we will explain latter), "date" which is the generation date, the file path or the instance to process, 
the size of this file and the parameters to process the instance with. In the descrition of the parameters, the first field is  
"parallel": it states whether or not the configuration is defined for a parallel execution or sequential one. 
Then follow, the general arguments of the parallel execution and the specific configuration of each block, thread or process of 
the parallel execution. In the case of XML inputs, QTuning considers the same structure, modeled with XML tags.  


\subsection{Retrieving  data on pushed projects: QTuningGet}

Once a project is pushed in QTuning, its tuning process can be analyzed given its key. For this purpose, the QTuning 
API proposes to use the QTuningGet class. The class supports two types of methods: (1) those related to the state of the 
process and (2) those related to online data that can be synthetized from the tuning. In the first type of methods, 
we can for instance: ask for the estimated number of exploration jobs that the tuning will generate, the number of tuning 
jobs that were executed or the energy consumption induced by these runs. In the former class, we can ask for: the average runtime 
deviation observed on one parameter, the best local configuration, the best set of $k$ configurations. 
We will not give a programming overview of the utilization of the QTuning Get API but the principles are close to the 
one used when pushing jobs. 


\subsection{QTuning server}

When a project is pushed, the server starts a set of uploads operations. They include: the creation of the project working directory, 
the registering of the project configuration in an application table, the downloading of the benchmark files required by the project, 
the generation of a set of configurations that will be explored. This done, the tuning tasks can start on the project through the 
server workers. Once it is free, a worker chooses a configuration for a project an run it on a benchmark file. 
The performance data on the configuration are then save in a Mongo Db database and set available to QTuning Get Objects. 
The choice of a configuration by a worker is determined by a {\it bi-level scheduler}: at a higher level, there is a 
fair-sharing scheduler that ensures that we do not favor any project. The fairness is based on two notions: the {\it common 
project activations} and the {\it common cpu time}. The first notion refers to the number of times where a worker chose a project, starting 
from the date where they were all pushed. The second refers to the total cpu time spent by workers on a project starting from the 
date where they were all pushed. The objective of the fair-sharing scheduler is to balance these two costs for each project. 
At a lower level of the bi-level scheduling, there is an exploration algorithm that once a project chosen, determines the 
combination (configuration, benchmark file) that will be explored. Here there are several explorations algorithms that QTuning 
implements. They will be discussed in the next section. 

Finally, let us notice that due to the in-situ computing, a tuning job can be interrupted anytime by the cloud resource manager. 
The server must then support various policies for resilience. This is achived in 
QTuning by the use of serialization: the state of the bi-level scheduler (activations, cpu time per project, configuration of 
local exploration) is saved in files,  input JSON data that are submitted and data collected during the execution of a tuning task also.

We end here the presentation of the QTuning architecture. In the next, we will deeply invest two features of its 
algorithmic implementation: these are the data exploration algorithms used in the bi-level scheduler and the data 
exploitation algorithm that serves for synthesis in QTuningGet. 

\section{Data exploration and exploitation in QTuning} \label{Exploration}

\subsection{Lexicographic search}

As stated in Section~\ref{Model}, we defined automatic tuning as a constraint optimization problem. 
A first solution for solving it is to iterarively generate configurations that are evaluated on 
$\beta$. The best local configuration is at each time returned to the cloud service to tune. 
We summarize this approach in the following algorithm.

	\begin{algorithm}                    
	\caption{\scriptsize Lexicographic Search} 	\label{alg1}  
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\scriptsize
	\STATE Choose a valid block, $Ceb_0 = (0, M_0, N_0, D_0, A_0)$ such that \\ $\forall j$, 
	$\displaystyle \left( \sum_{\substack{x \in M \\ (x, j) \in A_0 }} 1 \right)  = k_j$; 
	\STATE Add $Ceb_0$ to $CebList$;
	\STATE $e = \alpha(CebList)$; $l = 1$;
	\WHILE{$e < |x|$}
		\STATE Choose a valid  ceb $Ceb_l$ that is adjacent to $Ceb_{l-1}$;
		\STATE Add $Ceb_l$ to $CebList$;
		\STATE $e = \alpha(CebList)$; $l = l+1$
	\ENDWHILE
	\STATE Return $CebList$;
	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
	\normalsize

Criticize in stating that we do not have enough diversity..
Cirticize again the lack of diversity and state that we do not handle new benchmarks.
State that the global criticism is that these algorithms are DFS based. This does not matter when you only pursue the optimal. 
But if you consider the regret, instead of a 1D view of the search space, a 2D view is preferable. 

State that the best solution is to make BFS and DFS. Propose the consolidate-Explore algorithm. 

State that the combination of BFS and DFS was studied in prior works.
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.324.276&rep=rep1&type=pdf
 Explain why you consolidate (DFS : to have 
a largest comparable space). Why you explore: for diversity. 

Prior work investigated the combination of DFS and BFS. But none had the consolidation problem.

Introduce the randomized search and refer to ParamILS. Cirticize because we do not handle new benchmarks... 
State that the global problem is the 1D view of the exploration while we must consider a 2D view. 
Propose the consolidate-explore algorithm. 

Introduce in formulating the search problem in Qtuning as the one of minimizing the regret. 
State next that randomization is the only issue for this. Introduce the classical approach for 
random search developed in ParamILS. Criticize in stating that the exploration problem is a multi-dimensional problems, 
where the benchmark is again a dimension. Transform this formulation as a bidimensional random search (parameters: 
benchmark).  Then ask the question of exploitation: on which basis to compare?

Introduce the e-greedy algorithm and state a natural adaptation we can do: select k configurations, 
iterates over Benchmark instance and decide to tune or not the best configuration. Cirticize the elitism. 

Introduce the consolidate-explore version:


Search algorithm: consider k configurations.

We have a benchmark made of two sets B1 on which an exploration was performed and B2 on which exploration was not performed.

Choose a configuration in B1 with probability p and a configuration in p2 with probability 1-p. 

Conclude that the difference between the three approaches are comparable to the difference between DFS and BFS.



\subsection{Online result synthesis}

What is the best configuration? what are the parameters that do not make vary the performance? We could want 
to freeze them. Introduce the maximal subset intersection problem and present heuristics for resolution. 



\section{Proof-of-concept} \label{Proof-of-concept}


Introduce qombinatorics. 
Discuss about its portfolio solvers. 
Present source benchmark (race benchmark)

Compare the regret on the question of the best configuration with Random Search, e-greedy bandit and consolidate-explore+Maximal 
subset intersection. In both cases, choose a set of k initial configurations over which you iterate.


\section{Conclusion} \label{Conclusion}


The system currently is based on the Qarnot cloud. This implies that it deal with docker containers only and 
use the Qarnot APi for job submission.


Perspective: Other RMS, refine the definition of cross parameters (you might have many typeof undefs), rest API, 
other analytics function, evolving search.
